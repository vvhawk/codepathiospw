## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Spotify
- Personalized recommendations
- Make Playlists
- Add friends

YouTube
- Endless recommendations
- Picture in picture
- Custom Resolution

Telegram
- Fast, Fast, Fast
- Saved Messages
- Multiplatform

A cool idea would be an app inspired by my take on the prework. Users would be able to create a custom ID card that they can share with others. They can add stuff such as links to Social Media, Contact Info, or even what music they are currently listening to. A unique way to do this would be to compile QR codes since many apps have them nowadays.
